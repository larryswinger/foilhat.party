**September 11th 2021 marks the 20th anniversary of the deadliest attack on American soil. We invite you to add foil to your hat to signal that you know the truth about that day, and that you aren't afraid of ridicule. If we do this en masse, and share pictures on social media, we will raise awareness about something everyone should know. It will be an opportunity to inform people. We also hope to connect skeptics and the conspiracy aware by having them recognize each other on the streets. Let's make 9/11 a day when truth and justice prevail.**

-
We are proud free-thinkers and truth-seekers.

-
We are ordinary citizens who hold and share these convictions.

### What are **FoilHat.Party** and **Foil Hat Day**?

-
**FoilHat.Party** has three main objectives:

-
* Declare 9/11 a **Foil Hat Day**.  We encourage everyone around the world to add foil to their hat and wear it proudly all day long, every September 11th.

-
* Unify all people with questions, all skeptics, and all conspiracy analysts together, regardless of their differences of opinions, great and small, to simply agree with this statement: **The authorities, experts, governments, and corporate media's "official narrative" is NOT at all accurate.**

-
* Collect and openly share photo/video portraits of foiled hat people from around the world. These images can then be utilized for any purpose, including promotion of **Foil Hat Day** and documentaries about skepticism.

### Why is Foil Hat Day on September 11th?

-
Endless questions about 9/11 remain unanswered and taboo. The attacks are presented as the unquestionable foundations for the global "War On Terror."  The corporate media systematically meets all skepticism with ridicule, portraying any doubts as crazy beliefs held by "conspiracy theorists", a term weaponized by the CIA after JFK was assassinated.

-
The reality is that only a fraction of the population believe the "official narrative", and many are convinced that key government insiders were and are involved in the event and ongoing coverup.  **FoilHat.Party** hopes to help remove the taboo barriers blocking critical questions, to raise awareness about global skepticism, and to encourage people to speak out about controversial topics.

### How may I upload my photo/video?

-
If this message rings true to you, we invite you to wear foil on your hat on 9/11 and/or submit your photo/video in your foil hat.

-
You may emulate the example photos above or simply do your own thing.  Photos/videos do not need to be taken exclusively on 9/11.  The only request is that there be a hat with foil in the photo.

-
We hope to accumulate enough photos/videos to utilize in media projects, open to anyone anywhere, welcome to make their own media project.  Our hope is this **FoilHat.Party** project may evolve over years to come.

-
`More details coming soon.`

### Is there a FoilHat.Party social media campaign?
